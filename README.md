Wombat - Work-Based Assessment Tool
===================================

**Wombat** is a web-based application built using **ASP.NET Core** that supports the management of **work-based assessments (WBA)** for medical specialists using the **EPA (Entrustable Professional Activities)** approach. It is designed to be highly configurable, supporting multiple institutions, specialities, and subspecialities. The application is hosted on **Azure**, with a backend powered by **MS SQL**, also deployed in Azure.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

*   .NET Core SDK (v6 or later)
*   SQL Server or Azure SQL Database
*   Azure Account (for deployment)
*   [Visual Studio community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

### Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wombat.git
    cd wombat
    ```    
1.  Set up the database:

    To run Wombat on the development machine, simply run `update-database` in the package manager console and you should be ready to go.

    To run Wombat on Azure, 
    *   Create a SQL Server or Azure SQL Database instance and create a new database [Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-studio) works well.
    *   Generate a create script using `Script-Migration -Idempotent` in the package manager console and run the SQL script on your newly created database.
      
3.  Configure connection strings:
    
    *   Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your database.
    
    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server.database.windows.net;Database=wombat_db;User Id=your-username;Password=your-password;"
      }
    }
    ```    
4.  Run the application locally:
    
    ```bash  
    dotnet run
    ```
    
5.  Deploy to Azure:
    
    *   Follow the official Microsoft guide to deploy an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure: [Deploy an ASP.NET Core web app to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore).
